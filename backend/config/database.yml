# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password or a full connection URL as an environment
# variable when you boot the app. For example:
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV['MY_APP_DATABASE_URL'] %>

# Read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
